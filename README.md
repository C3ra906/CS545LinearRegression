# CS545LinearRegression
As a final group project for CS545 Machine Learning class, my groupmates and I implemented and trained two machine learning models to make predictions on stroke occurrences based on 10 potentially predictive features and a label indicating whether the patient has ever had a stroke. The 10 potentially predictive features are gender, age, history of hypertension, history of heart disease, marriage status, employment type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status. The data set had a total of 5,110 patient records. The purpose of the project was to implement and compare two different models of machine learning algorithms. The two models we chose were multilayer perceptron and logistic regression. I wrote the main code for logistic regression in Python, which is shared in the GitHub repository above. The dataset was very biased towards non-stroke patients, so we experimented with oversampling and undersampling the data to compare the results.<br/>
